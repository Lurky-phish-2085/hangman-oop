# Hangman OOP

Console Hangman game with an OOP design made in Java. Was made by me to apply
the basic concepts of OOP I've learned recently.

# System Requirements

Any devices that can access the terminal and has Java 18+ JRE installed on
the system.

# Installation and Running

It's not yet done yet, but a pre-release binary which represents the minimum
viable product is already available.

Download it from the releases page and put the `jar` file on any directory you
want.

Make sure you have Java 18+ installed to run this game.

Open up a terminal and `cd` to the directory where the `jar` file is located and then..

Type and press enter:

```
java -jar <path-to-jar-file>
```

Enjoy!
